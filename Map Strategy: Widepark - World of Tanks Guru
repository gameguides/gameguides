Widepark is only available for tiers 4 through 6 so it is often overlooked since you do not always play it depending which tiers you are working on.  Since Widepark is a small map it works well for the tier tanks that can play on it since their view range fits perfectly with Wideparkâ€™s size.  Looking at Widepark you will notice that the map is clearly split into a northern and southern side by a railroad cutting across the center of the map.  This railroad is raised across most of the map with the western side having an underpass and the eastern side of the railroad having less of a incline making it easier to cross.  Both teams are given their own side of the map and each has its own advantage since each side has a different layout.  The northern side has more wide open areas and is more difficult to defend the western side of the map.  The southern side has more buildings and cover, but at the same time it is harder to defend the eastern side of the map.
